# Cloud Backup Kit

Many cloud providers offer built-in managed backups, however it has not helped me to sleep better.
There also exists third-party service providers that manage your off-site backups.

In this repository you can find a collection of tools to do it yourself.
You will need at least a backup machine and a disk to put the data in e.g. a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) and SSD/HDD disk is sufficient for small applications.
